# Word on the Street

This app will allow people to interact anonymously with one another by placing messages at their current location.

### Description
This app will allow people to interact anonymously with one another by placing messages at their current location. Our vision for this project was to give users the ability to leave a review, suggestion, or hint to a treasure map. Kind of like the idea behind Geocaching. We wanted to leave it up to the community of an area to determine the core functionality of the app itself.
