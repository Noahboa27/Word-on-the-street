Description: This app will allow people to interact anonymously with one another by placing messages at their current location. Our vision for this project is to give users the ability to leave a review, suggestion, or hint to something. We want to leave it up to the community of an area to determine the core functionality of the app itself.

At this time, we need to implement the backend of the app such as the database and server communication. We are also currently trying to attach a message to a very specific location for accuracy so other users can read the message.

By the end of spring break we plan on having the front-end of the app finished and working. After that we will then finish up the back-end.
